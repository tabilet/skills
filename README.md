# A Minimal Engineering Harness

This repository is a copyable starting point for a lightweight project operating
system built around:

- `AGENTS.md` as the agent bootstrap guide.
- `memory-bank/` as the current project source of truth.
- `evolution/` as versioned history for direction changes.
- execution harnesses as repeatable commands that prove the software works.
- model eval harnesses as repeatable evaluations that measure model-assisted
  behavior.

The goal is not documentation volume. The goal is to give humans and agents the
same compact operating manual, then connect that manual to executable harnesses.

## Set Up A New Project

From a new project root:

```bash
cp /path/to/skills/AGENTS.md .
cp -R /path/to/skills/memory-bank .
cp -R /path/to/skills/evolution .
mkdir -p docs
```

Then edit the copied files in this order:

1. `memory-bank/product.md`: define what the project is and is not.
2. `memory-bank/architecture.md`: define layout, data flow, and boundaries.
3. `memory-bank/tech-stack.md`: define commands, dependencies, and harnesses.
4. `memory-bank/milestone.md`: define the first milestone.
5. `memory-bank/status.md`: define the first actionable rows.
6. `evolution/prompt-v1.md`: record the initial direction.
7. `evolution/result-v1.md`: record the current starting state.
8. `AGENTS.md`: replace placeholders with project-specific commands and rules.

Keep `README.md` simple and user-facing. Put long-form references in `docs/`.

## Set Up An Existing Project

For an existing project, read before writing:

```bash
find . -name '*.md' -print | sort
rg -n "TODO|FIXME|roadmap|architecture|security|deploy|test|release" .
rg --files
```

Then:

1. Read the root README, agent guides, docs, package READMEs, and major package
   comments.
2. Copy in `AGENTS.md`, `memory-bank/`, and `evolution/` from this repository.
3. Fill the memory bank from what the project already says, not from an imagined
   rewrite.
4. Move stable long-form references into `docs/`.
5. Convert duplicated roadmap/status material into `memory-bank/milestone.md`
   and `memory-bank/status.md`.
6. Keep known gaps visible in `status.md` instead of hiding them.

## Use The Memory Bank

The normal agent workflow is:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read the memory bank files in the order listed by `AGENTS.md`.
3. Tackle exactly one scoped task or status row.
4. Update the matching memory-bank file if scope, architecture, tools,
   milestone acceptance, or status changed.
5. Mark a row `[+]` only after verification passes.
6. Commit the row as a scoped unit.
7. If a milestone becomes complete, run the milestone review procedure in
   `memory-bank/milestone.md` before moving on.

Status rows use these markers:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[ ]` | Pending |
| `[+]` | Completed |
| `[~]` | In progress |
| `[!]` | Blocked |
| `[X]` | Cancelled |

## Install The API Harness

The API harness is account-level because it can drive any project that follows
this memory-bank shape.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin ~/.codex/prompts
cp /path/to/skills/.local/bin/tackle-memory-bank-api-loop ~/.local/bin/
cp /path/to/skills/.codex/prompts/tackle-next-memory-bank-todo.md ~/.codex/prompts/
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/tackle-memory-bank-api-loop
```

Run one row:

```bash
LLM_MODEL=gpt-5.5 OPENAI_API_KEY=... MAX_RUNS=1 tackle-memory-bank-api-loop .
```

Run a loop:

```bash
LLM_MODEL=gpt-5.5 OPENAI_API_KEY=... MAX_RUNS=5 tackle-memory-bank-api-loop .
```

Use an OpenAI-compatible provider:

```bash
LLM_API_BASE=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1 \
LLM_API_KEY=... \
LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.5 \
MAX_RUNS=1 \
tackle-memory-bank-api-loop .
```

Use a local OpenAI-compatible server:

```bash
LLM_API_BASE=http://localhost:1234/v1 \
LLM_MODEL=local-model-name \
MAX_RUNS=1 \
tackle-memory-bank-api-loop .
```

The harness embeds the task instruction in its API prompt. It does not call the
Codex CLI, and it does not require the external prompt file at runtime. The
prompt file is included as a reusable human/agent reference.

## What The Harness Is

For normal project work, `tackle-memory-bank-api-loop` is an execution harness:
it repeatedly runs an agent against a repository, gives it shell access through a
controlled command protocol, and checks git state between runs.

It becomes part of a model eval harness only when you score outcomes across
models, prompts, pass rates, review findings, cost, latency, or regressions.

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep `AGENTS.md` short.
- Keep project `README.md` user-facing.
- Put long explanations in `docs/`.
- Put active truth in `memory-bank/`.
- Put historical direction snapshots in `evolution/`.
- Update memory in the same commit as the code or docs it describes.
- Add a new evolution version only for a real direction change.
- Delete duplicate docs once useful content has been merged.
