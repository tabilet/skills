# Universal Multi-Milestone Goal Loop

This file defines a reusable protocol for executing an ordered set of project
milestones or status files from a slash-goal request. It is an execution
protocol, not a project roadmap, product specification, or status source.

Copying this file to another repository does not transfer project-specific
paths, lane names, commands, dependencies, or mutation authority. Those are
discovered from that project's instructions and supplied goal input.

## Instruction And Project Discovery

Before interpreting this protocol, obey the active system, developer, and user
instructions. Then discover project truth in this order:

1. The nearest applicable `AGENTS.md` files or equivalent repository
   instructions.
2. Product, architecture, technical, roadmap, decision/evolution, and status
   sources named by those instructions.
3. The status or milestone files supplied by the slash-goal request.
4. Current code, schemas, configuration examples, tests, documentation, and
   worktree state.

Project instructions define naming, status markers, repository boundaries,
required verification, documentation ownership, and commit discipline. Do not
invent a lane convention or directory layout when the project already has one.

If required sources cannot be discovered, complete safe read-only exploration
first. Ask the user only when a missing choice or authority would materially
change the result.

## Slash-Goal Input

A multi-milestone request should name this file and provide a linear execution
order. It may also provide project-context paths, a status-file map, downstream
impacts, and execution policies:

```text
/goal
Using GOAL.md, execute this loop.

PROJECT_CONTEXT:
- AGENTS.md
- path/to/roadmap.md

STATUS_ORDER:
F01 -> S01 -> O01 -> P01 -> X01?

STATUS_FILE_MAP:
F01 = path/to/status-F01.md
S01 = path/to/status-S01.md

DOWNSTREAM_IMPACTS:
F01 -> P01, O01
S01 -> P01, X01

COMMIT_POLICY: none
EXTERNAL_MUTATIONS: none
```

The identifiers above are examples only. They carry no meaning outside the
project that defines them.

Input rules:

- `PROJECT_CONTEXT` is optional. Use it to identify additional project sources
  that repository instructions do not already name.
- `STATUS_ORDER` is execution order. It contains milestone/status identifiers,
  not impact expressions.
- `STATUS_FILE_MAP` is optional when the roadmap or repository naming convention
  already resolves each identifier unambiguously.
- `DOWNSTREAM_IMPACTS` identifies pending specifications that must be
  reconsidered after a source milestone. An impact arrow does not authorize
  executing its targets early and does not replace declared dependencies.
- A `?` suffix means conditional. Skip that status without completing or
  cancelling it when its documented trigger is absent. Required statuses have
  no suffix.
- If `STATUS_ORDER` is omitted, use an unambiguous strict order from the
  project's roadmap. If no such order exists, request one rather than guessing.
- If the supplied order violates dependencies, correct the remaining order
  before execution and record why. Never ignore a prerequisite merely to
  preserve the original list.
- Treat the supplied impact map as a minimum. Reconcile additional consumers
  discovered from implementation and review.

## Initialization

Before the first milestone:

1. Read this file, applicable repository instructions, discovered project
   sources, and every status file in the requested order.
2. Inspect every in-scope worktree. Preserve unrelated user changes and do not
   overwrite or absorb them into milestone commits.
3. Resolve each identifier to exactly one status specification. Validate its
   naming and indexing against project conventions and reject ambiguous IDs.
4. Build a dependency graph from status dependencies, the supplied order,
   downstream impacts, and concrete code/configuration consumers.
5. Classify statuses as required, conditional, already completed, cancelled, or
   currently unavailable because of an external input.
6. Record the reconciled remaining order. Skip completed historical milestones
   rather than reimplementing them.
7. Determine required verification, commit policy, related repositories, and
   external-mutation authority before making changes.

## Milestone Loop

Execute the following loop for each required or triggered conditional status.
Keep at most one milestone in active implementation at a time unless project
instructions explicitly define safe parallel ownership.

### 1. Reconcile Before Starting

- Re-read the current status and relevant project sources; earlier milestones
  may have changed them.
- Confirm dependencies, triggers, required assets, and external inputs.
- Inspect current implementation and tests before assuming a task is missing.
- Rewrite obsolete pending tasks before implementation. Do not redo existing
  work merely because an older plan described it differently.
- Set only the current milestone/task to the project's in-progress state.

### 2. Implement Task Units

- Treat each project-defined task row or checklist item as an implementation
  and review unit.
- Preserve public interfaces, schemas, state formats, cache/storage contracts,
  configuration, CLI/HTTP behavior, and deployment compatibility unless the
  milestone explicitly changes them.
- Change related repositories in the same task only when project ownership and
  the goal scope include them.
- Update code-adjacent documentation and project memory/status sources in the
  same change as behavior, data, tooling, or operator-workflow changes.
- Use deterministic fixtures and project-approved disposable test resources.
  Never commit production secrets, customer/private data, captured traffic,
  generated local credentials, or environment-specific runtime state.
- Mark a task complete only after its acceptance and focused verification pass.

### 3. Verify And Deep-Review

- Run every verification command required by the status file and applicable
  repository instructions, plus proportionate tests for affected consumers.
- Exercise required migration, compatibility, rollback, security, concurrency,
  and failure-path checks for the changed surfaces.
- Run required checks in every related repository changed by the milestone.
- Deep-review correctness, failure semantics, security/privacy, compatibility,
  operations, and documentation after automated checks pass.
- Resolve review findings in the current milestone. Carry a finding forward
  only when it has a named pending owner and explicit rationale.
- Update the project's decision/evolution log only when its documented trigger
  is met.
- Mark the milestone complete only when all required tasks, acceptance
  criteria, verification, documentation, and review findings are closed.

### 4. Reconcile Downstream Work

Before advancing:

1. Open every pending status listed for the completed source in
   `DOWNSTREAM_IMPACTS`, plus additional affected consumers discovered during
   implementation or review.
2. Update dependencies, assumptions, tasks, acceptance criteria,
   compatibility/migration notes, verification, rollout, and rollback
   expectations to match the implementation that now exists.
3. Remove or rewrite obsolete work. If an earlier milestone implemented a later
   task, record lineage; do not mark the later milestone complete unless all of
   its acceptance criteria are satisfied.
4. Add newly discovered work to an existing pending owner when it fits. Create
   a new milestone/status ID only when project conventions allow it and the work
   is a distinct review unit.
5. Keep intentionally deferred work in the project's deferral/backlog source
   until its documented trigger is satisfied. Do not reserve an ID unless the
   project convention requires it.
6. Update the project roadmap when dependencies or remaining order change.
7. Recompute the dependency graph and remaining order. Continue automatically
   when the revised work remains within the goal's product scope and authority.

Pending status files are planning baselines until their implementation starts
and are expected to evolve. Completed historical files should change only for
factual correction, explicit ownership transfer, or lineage clarification.

### 5. Continue Or Stop

Continue while all of these remain true:

- the next milestone's dependencies and required inputs are available;
- remaining work stays within the slash-goal scope and mutation authority;
- no conflicting user-owned worktree change prevents safe implementation; and
- verification can establish the milestone acceptance criteria.

Do not guess or silently broaden scope when completion needs a new product or
policy choice, production credential, customer/platform requirement, external
account action, destructive migration, deployment authority, or unrelated
repository change. Complete safe in-scope work, leave the affected status
pending, record the exact blocker, and follow the active goal mechanism's
blocked-state rules.

Conditional milestones are skipped when their trigger is absent. They remain
pending and do not prevent completion of a goal that explicitly marked them
conditional. A required pending milestone prevents overall goal completion.

## Commit And External-Mutation Policy

`COMMIT_POLICY` values:

- `none` (default): do not create commits.
- `task`: create one focused commit per completed project-defined task unit
  after its verification passes.
- `milestone`: create one focused commit after each milestone closes.

Never commit unrelated user changes. Do not amend, rewrite history, push, merge,
tag, publish, or open a change request unless the slash-goal request explicitly
authorizes that action.

`EXTERNAL_MUTATIONS` defaults to `none`. Code implementation does not authorize
deployment, account/provider changes, credential rotation, live traffic,
payments, DNS changes, messages, or other external mutations. List authorized
systems, actions, and scopes explicitly. Resolve exact targets with read-only
checks before acting.

## Completion Report

At the end of each milestone, record:

- completed status and task units;
- material interface, data, configuration, UI, and operator changes;
- downstream specifications reconciled and any order change;
- verification and deep-review results;
- commits or external mutations, if authorized;
- conditional statuses skipped; and
- remaining blockers or external actions.

Mark the overall slash goal complete only when every required status in the
reconciled order is complete and no required work remains.
